    <li>As for my custom design, I wanted it to pop out in a way that makes the customer more interested by the layouts of my pages and to provide easy navigation through the website.</li>
    <br>
    <li>My 3 options were to either use W3Schools or Youtube, Wix or Framer. However, I had zero experience in neither wix nor framer with the time leading top to the end of this assignment. And so I decided to do everything manually just to learn furthermore on creating multiple web pages.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Some changes I made were mostly the alignment of the elements such as texts and images. Essentially just have them in the centre of the screen for the “easiness of the eyes”.</li>
